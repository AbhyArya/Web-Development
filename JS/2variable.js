/*


variables rules
1   similar to c++ ans also you can $ to use start variable

/*


different between let and var and const

var var1="hello";
var var1="hiiii";  --> you can declare variable with same name 

but in let you can only change value of variable but not declare again in scope

but in const you cannot change the value
